# Deep Learning for Image Analysis – IN3310 Mandatory Assignment 1

This repository contains the implementation for **Mandatory Assignment 1** in the course **IN3310 – Deep Learning for Image Analysis**.

## Files

- **Assignment1.py**  
  Main code file containing the training and evaluation pipeline for the assignment.

- **IN3310Mandatory1.pdf**  
  The original assignment description as provided in the course.

- **ResNet.py**  
  Implementation of the full ResNet architecture used in the assignment.

- **ResnetBlocks.py**  
  Contains the building blocks (residual blocks) that make up the ResNet architecture.

## Description

We implemented a ResNet-based model for image classification from scratch. The code includes training, validation, and result logging. For modularity, the architecture is split into two files: one for the overall network and one for the individual blocks used within the model.
